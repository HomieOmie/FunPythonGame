# Python Installation Guide

This guide will help you install Python on macOS, Linux, and Windows. Follow the steps below based on your operating system.

## macOS

### Step 1: Check if Python is already installed
macOS comes with Python pre-installed. To check if you have Python, open **Terminal** and run:

```bash
python3 --version
```

If you see a version number like `Python 3.x.x`, you're all set. If not, proceed with the installation.

### Step 2: Install Python using Homebrew
If Python is not installed, follow these steps:

1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) if it's not already installed. Open **Terminal** and run:

    ```bash
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```

2. Once Homebrew is installed, use it to install Python:

    ```bash
    brew install python
    ```

3. Verify the installation:

    ```bash
    python3 --version
    ```

### Step 3: Set up pip (Python's package manager)
Python should come with `pip` installed. Check by running:

```bash
pip3 --version
```

If pip is not installed, you can install it manually:

```bash
sudo easy_install pip
```

## Linux

### Step 1: Check if Python is already installed
Most Linux distributions come with Python pre-installed. You can check if Python is available by opening your **Terminal** and typing:

```bash
python3 --version
```

If Python is installed, you'll see a version number. If not, follow the steps below.

### Step 2: Install Python on Debian/Ubuntu-based distributions
To install Python on a Debian or Ubuntu system, use the following commands:

1. Update the package list:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    ```

2. Install Python:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
    ```

3. Verify the installation:

    ```bash
    python3 --version
    ```

### Step 3: Install Python on Red Hat/Fedora-based distributions
For Red Hat or Fedora users, follow these steps:

1. Install Python using the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo dnf install python3
    ```

2. Verify the installation:

    ```bash
    python3 --version
    ```

### Step 4: Set up pip (Python's package manager)
`pip` is usually installed along with Python, but you can check by running:

```bash
pip3 --version
```

If it's not installed, install it with:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip
```

## Windows

### Step 1: Download Python Installer
1. Go to the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) and download the latest version of Python for Windows.

### Step 2: Install Python
1. Run the installer you downloaded.
2. **Important**: Check the box that says **Add Python to PATH**.
3. Click **Install Now** and follow the instructions.

### Step 3: Verify the Installation
1. Open **Command Prompt** (you can search for `cmd`).
2. Check Python version by running:

    ```bash
    python --version
    ```

### Step 4: Set up pip (Python's package manager)
`pip` comes with Python installations on Windows. Verify it by running:

```bash
pip --version
```

If pip is not installed, you can install it by running:

```bash
python -m ensurepip --upgrade
```
